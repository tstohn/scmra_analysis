# Code to reproduce the results of the scMRA/scCNR manuscript

This code contains all the scripts to run the analyses of the scMRA/scCNR manuscript. You can find the scMRA/scCNR algorithm together with tutorials how to use it here:
https://github.com/ibivu/scmra

This repository is organized in the following way:

  - data: contains the simulated date (wt, BRAFmut, RASmut, missing total proteins with and without perturbations) as well as the processed data of the scID-seq experiment
  - paper_analyses: contains all the scripts for the evaluation of 1.) scMRA, 2.) scCNR, and the evaluation of 3.) the scID-seq data.
  - simulations: contains the simulations of the wt, BRAFmut and RASmut cell populations for the evaluation of scMRA, scCNR
